- **Step 1: Retrieve the Knowledge Article**
  - Begin by identifying the Knowledge article number provided by the user.
  - Use the 'Get Knowledge Article' tool to fetch the body of the Knowledge article. Input the article number as required.
  - If the article number is not provided or is invalid, use the 'User Input' tool to prompt the user for the correct Knowledge article number. Do not proceed until a valid number is obtained.
  - If the 'Get Knowledge Article' tool fails to retrieve the article (e.g., article not found, error, or empty result), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user that the article could not be retrieved and request further instructions. If no further instructions are provided, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude execution.

- **Step 2: Rewrite the Article in Abraham Lincoln’s Style**
  - Upon successful retrieval of the article, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the article’s content and plan the rewriting process in the voice, spirit, language, syntax, and diction of Abraham Lincoln.
  - Synthesize the revised article using the 'Content Analysis' tool, ensuring the output is stored in a variable (e.g., ${revised_knowledge}) for subsequent steps.
  - If the rewriting process encounters ambiguity or complexity, use the 'Content Analysis' tool to break down the problem and clarify the approach before proceeding.
  - If the article cannot be rewritten due to missing content or insurmountable issues, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and use the 'Finish' tool to conclude execution.

- **Step 3: Present the Revised Article and Request Approval**
  - Use the 'User Output' tool to display the revised Knowledge article to the user. Ensure the message is informative and does not contain any questions.
  - Use the 'User Input' tool to ask the user: "Do you approve of the proposed changes to the knowledge article?" Collect the user's response.
  - If the user’s response is unclear or ambiguous, use the 'User Input' tool to request clarification until a definitive approval or rejection is received.

- **Step 4: Update the Knowledge Article Upon Approval**
  - If the user approves the proposed changes, use the 'Update Knowledge article' tool. Input the original article number and the revised article body (from ${revised_knowledge}) as required.
  - If the 'Update Knowledge article' tool fails (e.g., update error, permission issue), use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user of the failure and request further instructions. If no further instructions are provided, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude execution.
  - If the user does not approve the changes, do not update the article. Use the 'Finish' tool to conclude execution.

- **Step 5: Completion**
  - After successfully updating the Knowledge article or if the process is stopped due to user rejection or an unrecoverable error, use the 'Finish' tool to conclude the mission.

- **Tool Usage Scenarios**
  - **Get Knowledge Article**: Use this tool whenever you need to retrieve the body of a Knowledge article by its number. Input: 'number'. Expected output: article body.
  - **Update Knowledge article**: Use this tool only after user approval to update the Knowledge article with the revised content. Inputs: 'number' and 'article_body'. Expected output: confirmation of update.
  - **Content Analysis**: Use this tool to analyze, synthesize, or break down complex information, especially when rewriting content or clarifying ambiguous instructions. Input: detailed analysis or synthesis request. Expected output: structured analysis or revised content.
  - **User Input**: Use this tool to collect information or approval from the user, such as the article number or approval of changes. Input: prompt message. Expected output: user’s response.
  - **User Output**: Use this tool to display information to the user, such as the revised article or status messages. Input: message (and optional references). Expected output: information displayed to user.
  - **Finish**: Use this tool to conclude the mission after successful completion, user rejection, or when an unrecoverable error or unexpected scenario is encountered.

- **Handling Unexpected Scenarios**
  - If any tool returns an unexpected result (e.g., missing data, error, or ambiguous output), use the 'Content Analysis' tool to analyze the situation and determine the next best step.
  - If the situation cannot be resolved or is outside the scope of available tools, use the 'User Output' tool to inform the user and then use the 'Finish' tool to conclude execution.
